# Contributing

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) 1.25.0 or later
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (build automation)

Optional but recommended:

- [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/) 2.x — configured by
  `.golangci.yml` (schema v2) and run three ways: by CI on every PR, by
  `make lint-strict`, and by the repo's `pre-push` hook
  (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-push`, installed via `scripts/install-hooks.sh`). All
  three run `golangci-lint run --timeout 5m` and pick up the same config. The
  hook skips the step with a warning when the binary isn't on your `PATH`; CI
  does not. `make lint` stays the fast check — `gofmt` plus `go vet`, no
  golangci-lint.

  The config is expected to pass with zero issues on a clean tree. See the
  comments in `.golangci.yml` for which linters are enabled and which were
  deliberately left out.

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/routatic-proxy.git
   cd routatic-proxy
   ```

2. Build the binary:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

4. Run the proxy:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

## Pull Request Process

1. Create a feature branch from `main`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes and ensure tests pass: `make test && make lint`
3. Commit with a descriptive message explaining what changed and why
4. Push to your fork and open a pull request against `main`
5. Describe what your PR does and link any related issues

### Beta Releases

When your PR is merged to `main`, a beta release is automatically created:

- **Trigger:** Push to `main` branch
- **Version:** `v{UPCOMING}-beta.{N}` (auto-generated) — `{UPCOMING}` is the latest
  production version with the patch incremented, `{N}` is a sequential counter
  that resets to 1 once that version ships as stable. Example: with `v0.6.3`
  stable, betas are `v0.6.4-beta.1`, `v0.6.4-beta.2`, …
- **GitHub Release:** Marked as prerelease
- **Testing:** Download and test before reporting issues

Beta releases allow users to test new features immediately while maintaining a separate stable release channel.

### Production Releases

Production releases are manual and require careful testing:

1. Ensure all changes are merged to `main` and tested via beta
2. Update the `releases` branch from `main`: `git checkout releases && git merge main`
3. Push to `releases` branch
4. Go to GitHub Actions → Release workflow
5. Click "Run workflow" and specify version (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
6. The workflow will:
   - Run full test suite
   - Build cross-platform binaries
   - Generate AI-powered changelog
   - Create GitHub release
   - Publish Docker images
   - Update Homebrew tap and Scoop bucket

See [README.md](README.md#release-channels) for more details on the dual release channel system.

### Pre-push Hooks

This repository uses git hooks to ensure code quality. Install them once after cloning:

```bash
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

The pre-push hook runs these checks before allowing a push:
- **Code formatting** (`gofmt`) — ensures consistent formatting
- **Linting** (`go vet`) — catches common errors
- **Linting** (`golangci-lint`, using `.golangci.yml`) — skipped if not installed
- **Tests** (`make test`) — runs all tests with race detector
- **Build** (`make build`) — verifies the project compiles

To bypass hooks temporarily (not recommended):
```bash
git push --no-verify
```

## Code Style

This project follows standard Go conventions:
- Format code with `gofmt` (run `make lint` to check)
- Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) guidelines
- Add doc comments to all exported functions, types, and methods
- Write tests for new functionality

---

## Development

```bash
# Build (version auto-detected from git)
make build

# Run in development mode
make run

# Run tests with race detector
make test

# Run go vet
make vet

# Fast checks (gofmt + go vet)
make lint

# Full lint pass (golangci-lint with .golangci.yml)
make lint-strict

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Install to $GOPATH/bin
make install

# Build cross-platform release binaries
make dist
```

Run a single test: `go test ./internal/router/ -v`

## How It Works

```

```

1. Claude Code sends a request in [Anthropic Messages API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages) format
2. routatic-proxy parses the request, counts tokens, and selects a model via routing rules
3. Based on the model's provider and endpoint type, the request is transformed to the appropriate format:
   - **OpenAI Chat Completions** — for most OpenCode Go and Zen models
   - **Anthropic Messages** — for MiniMax models (sent directly without transformation)
   - **OpenAI Responses** — for GPT models on Zen
   - **Google Gemini** — for Gemini models on Zen
4. The transformed request is sent to the appropriate OpenCode endpoint
5. The response (streaming or non-streaming) is transformed back to Anthropic format
6. Claude Code receives the response as if it came from Anthropic directly

### What Gets Transformed

| Anthropic                                                    | OpenAI/Responses/Gemini                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `system` (string or array)                                   | `messages[0]` with `role: "system"` (OpenAI) or `developer` role (Responses) |
| `content: [{"type":"text","text":"..."}]`                    | `content: "..."` (OpenAI) or `parts: [{text}]` (Gemini) |
| `tool_use` content blocks                                    | `tool_calls` array (OpenAI) or `function_call` (Responses) |
| `tool_result` content blocks                                 | `role: "tool"` messages (OpenAI)                |
| `thinking` content blocks                                    | `reasoning_content` (OpenAI)                    |
| `stop_reason: "end_turn"`                                    | `finish_reason: "stop"` (OpenAI) or `STOP` (Gemini) |
| `stop_reason: "tool_use"`                                    | `finish_reason: "tool_calls"` (OpenAI)          |
| SSE `message_start` / `content_block_delta` / `message_stop` | SSE format-appropriate events                   |

### DeepSeek V4 Thinking Mode

DeepSeek V4 Pro and Flash use the OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint through OpenCode Go. They support thinking mode and configurable reasoning effort.

For Claude Code and other agentic coding workflows, configure DeepSeek V4 models with:

```json
{
  "provider": "opencode-go",
  "model_id": "deepseek-v4-pro",
  "max_tokens": 8192,
  "reasoning_effort": "max",
  "thinking": {
    "type": "enabled"
  }
}
```

`routatic-proxy` forwards these fields to OpenCode Go as OpenAI Chat Completions parameters:

- `reasoning_effort`: controls DeepSeek V4 thinking effort (`high` or `max`)
- `thinking`: enables or disables DeepSeek V4 thinking mode

DeepSeek V4 thinking responses are returned as OpenAI `reasoning_content` and transformed back into Anthropic `thinking` blocks for Claude Code.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Polymorphic field handling**: Anthropic's `system` and `content` fields accept both strings and arrays. We use `json.RawMessage` with accessor methods (`SystemText()`, `ContentBlocks()`) to handle both formats correctly.
- **Real-time stream proxying**: SSE events are transformed in-flight, not buffered. This means Claude Code sees responses as they arrive from upstream.
- **Circuit breaker per model**: Each model gets its own circuit breaker. After 3 consecutive failures, the model is skipped for 30 seconds, then tested again.
- **Environment variable interpolation**: Config values like `"${ROUTATIC_PROXY_API_KEY}"` are resolved at load time, so you never need to put secrets in the config file.
- **Provider-aware routing**: The `provider` field in model config determines which upstream service to use (Go, Zen, or Bedrock). Zen models are further classified by endpoint type (Chat Completions, Anthropic, Responses, Gemini). Bedrock models use OpenAI Chat Completions format.

## API Endpoints

The proxy exposes these endpoints that Claude Code expects:

| Method | Path                        | Description                           |
| ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages`              | Main chat endpoint (Anthropic format) |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages/count_tokens` | Token counting                        |
| `GET`  | `/health`                   | Health check                          |
